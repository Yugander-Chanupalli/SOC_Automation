# Next-Generation Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation

This repository contains the implementation of a next-generation **Security Operations Center (SOC) automation framework**. This project leverages open-source technologies such as **Wazuh**, **Shuffle**, and **Azure** to address challenges in traditional SOCs, including alert overload, manual processes, and delayed responses. The proposed solution integrates **SIEM**, **SOAR**, and **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** capabilities to enable proactive threat detection and mitigation.

## **Abstract**
Traditional SOCs face significant challenges in managing modern cybersecurity threats due to their reliance on manual processes. This project presents an automated SOC framework that enhances threat detection, streamlines investigation processes, and facilitates proactive threat mitigation through automation. The framework incorporates advanced SIEM, SOAR, and CTI technologies to minimize analyst workload, reduce human error, and improve security posture. The solution is evaluated in a simulated environment, comparing its performance to conventional manual approaches.

## **Introduction**
In today’s interconnected digital landscape, organizations must protect critical assets from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Traditional SOCs struggle to keep pace due to:

1. **Alert Overload**: Large volumes of alerts often contain false positives, overwhelming analysts.
2. **Manual Processes**: Reactive, human-driven incident response introduces delays and risks of human error.
3. **Limited Integration**: Disparate tools impede comprehensive threat correlation and detection.

This project proposes a scalable SOC framework with the following goals:
- Automate alert handling and response.
- Enhance proactive threat detection using CTI.
- Integrate SIEM and SOAR capabilities for improved efficiency.

---

## **Problem Statement**
### Key Challenges in Traditional SOCs:
1. **Inefficient Alert Handling**: Manual triage is time-consuming and prone to error.
2. **Reactive Posture**: Focus on responding to incidents after they occur.
3. **Limited Scalability**: Inability to handle increasing security events effectively.

---

## **Proposed Solution**
The proposed SOC framework incorporates the following elements:

1. **Centralized Security Monitoring**:
   - Deployment of Wazuh agents across endpoints for real-time data collection.
   - Use of advanced correlation rules to reduce false positives.

2. **Security Orchestration and Automation (SOAR)**:
   - Integration with Shuffle to automate workflows and playbooks.
   - Automated alert prioritization and incident response.

3. **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Integration**:
   - Enrichment of alerts with contextual data from MISP and OpenCTI platforms.

4. **Collaborative Incident Management**:
   - Centralized platform for structured workflows and team collaboration.

---

## **Architecture**
The architecture integrates SIEM, SOAR, and CTI components to form a unified SOC framework.

### Key Components:
1. **Wazuh**: Collects and centralizes security event data.
2. **Shuffle**: Automates workflows and enriches alerts.
3. **Azure**: Provides a cloud environment for scalable deployment.

## **Methodology**
The project follows a structured methodology divided into the following phases:

### 1. **Centralized Security Monitoring**
- **Deployment**: Wazuh agents installed on endpoints to monitor logs, network traffic, and file integrity changes.
- **Data Aggregation**: Events centralized using the Wazuh Manager for correlation and analysis.

### 2. **Security Orchestration and Automation**
- **Workflow Automation**: Shuffle automates alert routing and responses using predefined playbooks.
- **Email Notifications**: Alerts trigger customizable email notifications for timely action.

### 3. **Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration**
- **CTI Sources**: Data from platforms like MISP and OpenCTI enriches alerts with contextual information.
- **Threat Context**: Analysts receive actionable insights to prioritize and address threats.

### 4. **Collaborative Incident Management**
- **Platform Integration**: A centralized system for assigning tasks, sharing findings, and documenting responses.
- **Workflow Consistency**: Standardized processes ensure thorough incident investigation and resolution.

## **Implementation**
### **1. Centralized Monitoring with Wazuh**
- Wazuh agents are deployed across endpoints and configured to log events such as unauthorized access, suspicious file modifications, and malware detection.
- Security events are forwarded to the Wazuh Manager for centralized analysis.

### **2. Automation with Shuffle**
- Alerts raised by Wazuh are routed through Shuffle for processing.
- Shuffle workflows automate actions such as blocking IPs, isolating endpoints, or notifying analysts.

### **3. CTI Enrichment**
- Shuffle integrates with MISP and OpenCTI to fetch threat intelligence data.
- Alerts are enriched with contextual information, improving detection and response accuracy.

### **4. Email Notifications**
- Critical alerts trigger email notifications, ensuring real-time updates to SOC analysts.

## **Results**
The proposed solution demonstrated significant improvements in SOC operations:

1. **Enhanced Threat Detection**:
   - Centralized monitoring reduced false positives and improved event correlation.

2. **Improved Response Efficiency**:
   - Automated workflows minimized manual intervention and reduced response times.

3. **Contextualized Alerts**:
   - CTI integration enriched alerts with actionable insights.

### **Example Alert Notification**

## **Future Scope**
1. **AI/ML Integration**: Explore machine learning for advanced threat detection.
2. **Scalability**: Adapt the framework for hybrid and cloud-native infrastructures.
3. **Enhanced Playbooks**: Develop more sophisticated workflows for evolving threats.
